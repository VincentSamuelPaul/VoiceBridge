# 📞 VoiceBridge

**Bridging AI and Rural Communities via a Simple Phone Call**

VoiceBridge is an AI-powered voice assistant designed to help people in remote areas—especially **farmers**—get answers to their questions using only a basic phone call. No smartphones. No internet. Just voice.

## 🌾 Why VoiceBridge?

Many rural communities, especially farmers, often lack access to smartphones, stable internet, or digital literacy—but they *do* have access to basic mobile phones. VoiceBridge was built to bridge this digital divide.

> **How it works:**
> 1. A user calls a designated number and speaks their question (e.g., "When should I plant rice this season?")
> 2. They hang up after asking.
> 3. The AI agent processes the query.
> 4. Within moments, the AI calls back with a spoken answer—no internet required.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Technical Overview)

1. **Call Handling**  
   - Incoming voice calls are received via Twilio / similar service.
   - Voice input is recorded and transcribed.

2. **AI Processing**  
   - Transcription is passed to an AI backend (like OpenAI GPT or similar).
   - The agent formulates a natural-language response.

3. **Callback System**  
   - AI response is converted to voice via TTS (text-to-speech).
   - The system places a callback to the original caller and speaks the answer.

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

> **Caller:** "What pesticide should I use for tomato leaf curl virus?"  
> *(hangs up)*
